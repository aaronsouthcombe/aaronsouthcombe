# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hey there! I'm Aaron, and I'm excited to share my journey of exploring efficiency, creating innovative projects, and diving into the depths of programming languages like Rust and Python. With a background in network administration and platform integration, I'm all about tackling new challenges and learning about how things work at the lowest level.

## About Me

- Currently exploring Rust and Python to create functional applications.
- Passionate about creating efficient and impactful solutions.
- Love learning new concepts and technologies to build innovative projects.
- Background in network administration brings a unique perspective to my work.
- Experienced in integrating platforms to create seamless experiences.

## My Interests

### Programming Languages

#### Rust
Rust has captivated me with its focus on memory safety, performance, and powerful abstractions. I'm excited to explore its unique concepts like ownership, lifetimes, and zero-cost abstractions, especially coming from a background in python.

#### Python
Using python I started my journey into application development and created platforms for monitoring PBX systems for possible hacks, web applications using Flask and jinja templates, FastAPI to create a SolarWinds search engine, and ssh scripts with paramiko to automate network node management.

### Linux and Efficiency

Efficiency extends beyond programming languages to the very systems we use. As an advocate for efficiency, I deeply appreciate the power of Linux and other efficient operating systems. Their clutter-free, simple architectures provide a solid foundation to achieve our goals effectively. Most of the code I publish is developed and deployed or implemented on GNU/Linux targets.
