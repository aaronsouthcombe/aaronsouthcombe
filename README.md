# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hey there! I'm Aaron, and I'm excited to share my journey of exploring efficiency, creating innovative projects, and diving into the depths of programming languages like Rust and Python. With a background in network administration and platform integration, I'm all about tackling new challenges and learning about how things work at the lowest level.

## About Me

- 🌱 Currently exploring Rust, Go, and pushing the boundaries of Python.
- 🔥 Passionate about creating efficient and impactful solutions.
- 💡 Love learning new concepts and technologies to build innovative projects.
- 🖧 Background in network administration brings a unique perspective to my work.
- 🤝 Experienced in integrating platforms to create seamless experiences.

## My Interests

### Programming Languages

#### Rust
Rust has captivated me with its focus on memory safety, performance, and powerful abstractions. I'm excited to explore its unique concepts like ownership, lifetimes, and zero-cost abstractions, especially coming from a background in python.

#### Python
Using python I started my journey into application development and created platforms for monitoring PBX systems for possible hacks, web applications using Flask and jinja templates, FastAPI to create a SolarWinds search engine, and ssh scripts with paramiko to automate network node management.
